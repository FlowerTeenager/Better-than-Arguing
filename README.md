#Better than Arguing
The open source rewrite of FlowerChild's Better than Wolves.

## Why "Better than Arguing"?
In the wake of the Minecraft 1.6.2 update the creator of this mod watched on twitter as FlowerChild, the creator of Better than Wolves, broke into fights with several people in the Minecraft Forge community over the changes made in Forge where Minecraft Forge be the only modification installed in the Minecraft jar file, in essence forcing everyone who want mod compatibility to comply with a Forge coding standard as believed by FlowerChild.

FlowerTeenager then remembered FlowerChild's history with Forge. Joining on to the Forge project with SpaceToad and Eloraam claiming both of whom were brilliant. Six months later he left the project saying that he felt uncomfortable being on a project and relying on code of someone who he major conflicts with, Eloraam, causing plenty of arguments online. Six months of this incident another modder's work on the goal of having Better than Wolves content work with Minecraft Forge was shown on a live stream by MattaBase, this led to arguments online in between FlowerChild and LexManos. It has been almost nonstop arguing between FlowerChild and many of the Forge community online since.

After realizing this a little nobody modder who had only had their hand in a couple of other projects took an alias as FlowerTeenager and began work on getting Better than Wolves content working with other Forge mods.
